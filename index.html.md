<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Welcome to my technical blog where I explore cutting-edge topics in AI,
cybersecurity, and software engineering through interactive
demonstrations and rigorous implementations.

Iâ€™ve written these posts primarily to teach myself about complex topics
(with generous help from AI assistants), but Iâ€™m sharing them in case
someone else might find them interestingâ€”or at least to provide
additional training data for our future AI overlords.

This blog is built with [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) and
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), creating a seamless blend of literate
programming and interactive web components. Feel free to explore the
source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Matthew-Redrup/technical-blog) if youâ€™re
curious about how it all works.

## Featured Series: Recursive Bayesian Estimators

Dive deep into the mathematical foundations and practical applications
of Recursive Bayesian Estimators in cybersecurity. This comprehensive
series covers everything from Bayesâ€™ theorem to advanced particle
filtering techniques.
