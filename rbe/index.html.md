<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Series Overview

This comprehensive series takes you from the fundamental mathematical
principles of Bayesian inference to practical implementations of
Recursive Bayesian Estimators (RBE) in cybersecurity applications.

### What You’ll Learn

- **Mathematical Foundations**: Bayes’ theorem, probability theory, and
  sequential inference
- **Recursive Updating**: How beliefs evolve over time with new evidence
- **Particle Filters**: Advanced Monte Carlo methods for complex
  distributions

  assessment
- **Practical Implementation**: Complete Python implementations with
  performance optimization
- **Modern Context**: How RBE fits with current AI/ML approaches

### Prerequisites

- Python programming experience
- Basic probability and statistics
- Familiarity with NumPy and matplotlib
- Understanding of network concepts (helpful but not required)

### Series Structure

Each part builds progressively on previous concepts while including
complete, runnable code examples and interactive visualizations.
